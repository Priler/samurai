# ðŸ‘¹ Samurai Telegram Bot

Simple, yet effective moderator bot for telegram. With reports, logs, profanity filter and more :3

# Description

Personal bot, made for easy chat auto-moderation.  
Adds reporting functionality, profanity filtering (both english & russian languages are supported), logging system via
private channel and much more!  
More of that, the bot code & functions can be easily extended and/or limited as you prefer.

*The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons
of improvements that can be made.*
