![Samurai Telegram Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S9BPDMt.jpeg "te")
Simple, yet effective **moderator bot for telegram**.  
With reports, logs, profanity filter, anti-spam AI and more :3

# What samurai do?
Samurai is a personal bot, made for easy chat auto-moderation.  
It adds reporting functionality, profanity filtering (both english & russian languages are supported), logging system via private channel, spam detection AI, NSFW detection AI and much more!  
More of that, the bot code and functions can be easily extended and/or limited as you prefer.  

*The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.*
