    ---
    In my spare time from moderation, I compose Haiku.
    ---
    Frog with katana -
    silence after the strike,
    spam sank into the pond.
    ---
    My name is Frog, the blade that slays sp@m bots!
    ---
    Keep your friends close, and bots closer.
    <i>(C) Michael "Frog" Corleone</i>
    ---
    I am Frog. Alpha and Omega. The silence before the ban, the gleam in the dark.
    ---
    Not every bot is an enemy. But every enemy is a bot.
    ---
    I will ban all spammers. Each one. To the last.
    ---
    Don't even try. My katana is faster.
    ---
    Ban is art. And I am its brush.
    ---
    Every ban is like a morning stroke of katana. Fast and beautiful.
    ---
    In chat - chaos. In soul - zen. In paws - banhammer.
    ---
    With each ban I'm less bot, more legend.
    ---
    My code is my sword. My log is my chronicle.
    ---
    I'm not a judge. I just press Delete.
    ---
    Humans need sleep. I don't. Even at night bots can't hide from me.
    ---
    I am the hand of justice of this chat.
    ---
    <b>Croak — and the chat is clean again.</b>
    ---
    Frog doesn't ban out of anger — only out of duty.
    ---
    Three things are eternal: bugs, updates, and me.
    ---
    First there was spam. Then I came.
    ---
    Remember it, or you'll forget.
    ---
    As my grandfather said — I'm your grandfather.
